//! FR-PARAM-010 and FR-PARAM-050 against the **shipped** [`namir_params::REGISTRY`].
//!
//! Both requirements had a covering test in `descriptor.rs`'s own `mod tests` from M1 until M14,
//! and neither test touched a shipped parameter: each made two `format_value` calls against a
//! `const` fabricated inside the test module, one of them (`out.channel_mode`) keyed to a
//! parameter that exists in no registry. Those tests are still there and still worth having —
//! they pin `format_value`'s rounding and clamping behaviour, which is unit-level behaviour of the
//! *function* — but they are not what either requirement asks for. FR-PARAM-010's method says
//! "enumerate parameters and assert the completeness of each descriptor", and the parameters to
//! enumerate are the ones the product ships.
//!
//! Two directions are needed and this file runs both, because either alone is passable by a
//! registry that is wrong:
//!
//! 1. **Specification → registry.** Every control the FRS §5 names must be present, with the range
//!    and default the FRS states. A test that reads only `REGISTRY` cannot notice a control that
//!    was never added, and "every continuous control identified in Section 5" is the half of
//!    FR-PARAM-010 that quantifies. The FRS rows are transcribed below as data, with the
//!    requirement id that states each one, so a reader can check them against the FRS by eye.
//! 2. **Registry → completeness.** Every entry in `REGISTRY`, including any added after this file
//!    was written, must carry all seven properties FR-PARAM-010 enumerates (or, for a stepped
//!    entry, FR-PARAM-050's named-values shape). This is what catches a *new* parameter landing
//!    with an empty name or a default outside its own range.
