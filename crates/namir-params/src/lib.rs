//! D-5.1's role for this crate: "Parameter identity, ranges, formatting, smoothing, automation
//! intake." This crate is the *system*: the stable id derivation FR-PARAM-020 requires, the
//! descriptor shape FR-PARAM-010/050 require, the smoothing-category declarations D-10.3
//! assigns, and the checked-in manifest mechanism D-10.1 requires. It is not itself parameters —
//! see [`REGISTRY`] below.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! In scope, and closed by this crate at M1 (`03-implementation-roadmap.md` §5):
//! - FR-PARAM-010 — [`ParamDescriptor`]: key, [`ParamId`], name, [`Unit`], range/default (via
//!   [`ParamKind::Continuous`]), and a [`ValueFormat`].
//! - FR-PARAM-020 — [`ParamId::from_key`]'s permanent FNV-1a derivation (see `id.rs`) plus
//!   [`render_manifest`]/[`check_manifest`]'s enforcement that an existing entry's identifier or
//!   kind never changes and a retired entry is tombstoned, never silently dropped. Since
//!   `params.lock`'s format version 2 the manifest also records each parameter's range, default
//!   and stepped-value fingerprint, so a change to *those* is a diff a reviewer sees rather than a
//!   silent reinterpretation of every saved preset (issue #121).
//! - FR-PARAM-050 — [`ParamKind::Stepped`], with named values and a [`descriptor::StepIndex`]
//!   value-representation type, instead of forcing discrete choices through a continuous range.
//! - D-10.2 — the `stage_instance` field on every descriptor, present and zeroed now so RD-2's
//!   future dynamic chain can grow without renumbering existing parameters.
//! - D-10.3 — [`SmoothingCategory`], declaring which `namir-dsp` primitive a future stage reaches
//!   for, without this crate depending on `namir-dsp` or performing any smoothing itself.
//!
//! Out of scope, deliberately, for this crate:
//! - FR-PARAM-030 (accepting changes from UI/CLAP automation/preset loading) and FR-PARAM-040
//!   (actually smoothing a value stream) — both are `namir-engine`'s job once real stages exist
//!   at M2. `namir-engine`'s existing `ParamId`/`ParamChange` (`crates/namir-engine/src/
//!   param.rs`) are a separate, deliberately bare RT-path type; wiring them to
//!   [`ParamDescriptor`]/[`ParamKind::Stepped`] is explicitly M2's work, not this crate's.
//! - FR-PARAM-060 (a modulation/automation-appropriateness flag) — not yet designed; left for
//!   whichever milestone first needs to distinguish per-sample-automatable parameters from
//!   configuration-like ones.
//!
//! # [`REGISTRY`], M2 onward
//!
//! M2 (`03-implementation-roadmap.md` §6) lands the six 1.0 product stages (Trim/Gate/Nam/Ir/Eq/
//! Out) in `namir-engine`, and [`REGISTRY`] is populated here with each stage's descriptor set —
//! see the [`stages`] module, one submodule per stage per D-10.1's "declared in one place per
//! stage". `namir-engine`'s stage implementations reference these same `const`s (by id) rather
//! than re-declaring ranges/defaults, so there is exactly one source of truth per parameter.
//!
//! - D-10.4 (added M6) — the [`global`] module: two descriptors, `global.bypass` and
//!   `global.output_ceiling_db`, for chain-level state (FR-CHAIN-030/090) that isn't owned by any
//!   one of the six stages. See that module's doc comment for why these were missing from
//!   [`REGISTRY`] until now.
