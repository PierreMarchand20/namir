//! Ir stage (FR-IR-040..100): wraps `namir_ir::PreparedIr`/`IrState` with the D-8.1
//! crossfade-capable dual-resource shape (FR-IR-060/FR-IR-080), the shared per-stage bypass
//! crossfade (FR-CHAIN-020), FR-IR-070's level/low-cut/high-cut controls on the wet path, and
//! this stage's own true-stereo-width channel handling.
//!
//! # Structural mirror of `nam.rs`, three differences
//!
//! This stage is `nam.rs`'s D-8.1 dual-resource-slot shape (two live [`IrSlot`]s, an equal-power
//! [`Crossfade`] between them driven by [`IrStage::load_ir`], the same shared bypass
//! `mix`/`mix_target`/`mix_coeff` pattern) with three changes:
//!
//! 1. **No per-block resampling wrapper.** `namir_ir::PreparedIr::from_wav_bytes` resamples once
//!    at load time (FR-IR-030), so an [`IrSlot`] is just `{ ir: Arc<PreparedIr>, state: IrState }`
//!    — no `nam.rs`-style `SlotResampler`/FIFO machinery.
//! 2. **True stereo width.** Gate/Nam are mono-core (FR-CHAIN-050): they run channel 0 only and
//!    duplicate the result onto every other channel. Ir cannot do that and still honor
//!    FR-CHAIN-060's "stereo IR, or dual mono IR" — a stereo IR's two channels must reach two
//!    distinct physical output channels. So instead of a channel-0-then-duplicate shuttle, this
//!    stage always calls `PreparedIr::process_block` with exactly `ir.channel_count()` outputs
//!    (that API's own contract — see [`IrSlot::process_wet`]) and then *reads back* from those
//!    produced channels per physical output channel via [`wet_channel_index`], duplicating
//!    channel 0 when the IR has fewer channels than the chain (dual mono, FR-CHAIN-060), or
//!    dropping the IR's extra channel(s) when the chain has fewer than the IR (a stereo IR loaded
//!    into a `Mono` chain — an edge case FR-CHAIN-060 doesn't explicitly ask for, but one this
//!    stage handles rather than panics on: "just use the IR's channel 0").
//! 3. **`tail_samples()` is nonzero.** Ir is the one stage in the fixed six-stage chain whose own
//!    processing can still produce non-negligible output after its input goes silent
//!    (`chain.rs`'s own doc comment: "at most one stage with a nonzero tail"). See
//!    [`Stage::tail_samples`]'s impl below.
//!
//! Everything else — the two-fades reasoning, the `mix_target` recomputation triggers (including
//! issue #141's widening of them, and [`IrStage::begin_crossfade`]'s snap), and D-8.1's four-step
//! handover including the two audio-thread drop sites M4 closed (a completing handover's outgoing
//! slot, and a displaced still-fading-in slot) — is identical in spirit to `nam.rs`'s own module
//! doc comment; read that first, this doc comment only covers what differs. Issue #141 reproduced
//! identically on both stages (the wet signal first appearing at frame 512, 768, 896 or 959 for
//! block sizes 512, 256, 64 and 1) and is fixed identically on both, with one difference this
//! stage's own extra wet-path processing forces — see [`IrStage::wet_path_is_transparent`].
//!
//! # The handover crossfade is per physical channel, not mono-core
//!
//! Because point 2 above means this stage's wet signal is not a single channel duplicated,
//! [`IrStage::process_wet`]'s handover blend runs its equal-power `theta` recurrence
//! independently for *every* physical output channel (not once, on channel 0, the way `nam.rs`'s
//! `process_channel0` does) — but from the exact same starting `remaining` and the exact same
//! per-sample recurrence for every channel, only committing the last channel's trajectory back to
//! `self.crossfade`, for the identical in-phase reason the shared bypass blend's own per-channel
//! loop (below, and in every other bypassable stage) does the same thing with `mix`.
//!
//! # FR-IR-070 order: convolve → HP/LP → level, all on the wet path before the outer blend
//!
//! So that toggling `ir.enabled` bypasses the whole IR+filter+level chain cleanly (not just the
//! convolution), the low-cut/high-cut `Biquad`s and the level `GainRamp`s run unconditionally on
//! whatever `process_wet` produced (a real convolution, or the dry passthrough FR-CHAIN-040 uses
//! when nothing is loaded) — their own `*_enabled` toggles are independent of `ir.enabled` and
//! (like `eq.rs`'s HP/LP) are expressed as smooth coefficient interpolation to
//! `BiquadCoeffs::identity()`, not as a second dry/wet blend. The *shared* bypass blend runs last,
//! exactly as `nam.rs`'s doc comment describes for its own two composed fades.
