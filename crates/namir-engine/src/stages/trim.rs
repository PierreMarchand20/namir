//! Trim stage (FR-IN-010/020/030/040): input gain with a click-free ramp, an optional DC-blocking
//! high-pass, and metering — plus, uniquely among the six stages
//! (`03-implementation-roadmap.md` §6), the chain's *only* real cross-channel mixing.
//!
//! Runtime order is `gate → trim → ...` (D-9.8; see `stages/mod.rs`'s doc comment), not
//! FR-CHAIN-010's literal prose order — this module doesn't need to know that, it just
//! implements Trim itself.
//!
//! # Why Trim owns the downmix
//!
//! `StageIo`'s channel count is fixed for the whole chain to
//! `ctx.channel_config().output_channels()` (`stage_io.rs`'s own doc comment). Every stage after
//! this one relies on the invariant "every channel carries an identical signal whenever
//! `channel_count() > 1`" (FR-CHAIN-050: Gate/Nam are mono-core, Eq/Out process channels
//! independently off a shared parameter target — neither shape needs or wants channels to
//! diverge). Establishing that invariant from whatever the host handed in is Trim's job: for
//! `MonoToStereo` both channels already carry the same duplicated signal, so the -6 dB-both-terms
//! sum below is a no-op by construction (it re-derives the same shared signal, just attenuated,
//! not a blend of two different signals); for `Stereo` the channels genuinely differ, and the
//! same rule performs FR-CHAIN-060's default "2 ch summed to the mono core at -6 dB". One rule,
//! two configurations, no per-configuration branching needed.
//!
//! Trim is not in FR-CHAIN-020's bypassable list, so unlike Gate/Nam/Ir/Eq this stage has no
//! dry/wet crossfade machinery.
