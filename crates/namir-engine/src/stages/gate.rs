//! Gate stage (FR-GATE-010..040): `namir_dsp::NoiseGate` wired into the `Stage` trait, the
//! shared per-stage bypass crossfade (FR-CHAIN-020), and FR-CHAIN-050's mono-core-then-duplicate
//! channel handling.
//!
//! Runtime order is `gate → trim → ...` (D-9.8; see `stages/mod.rs`'s doc comment) — this module
//! doesn't need to know that, it just implements Gate itself.
//!
//! # Why this is mono-core
//!
//! FR-CHAIN-050 treats Gate as conceptually mono: by the time this stage runs, every channel of
//! `io` already carries an identical signal (an invariant either Trim establishes downstream of
//! here, for `channel_count() > 1`, or that trivially holds for a true mono chain) since Gate
//! itself runs *before* Trim in this chain (D-9.8). Detecting and gating on channel 0 alone, then
//! duplicating the result, keeps that invariant intact for whatever comes next rather than
//! running (and potentially diverging) an independent detector per channel.
