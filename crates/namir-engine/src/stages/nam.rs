//! Nam stage (FR-NAM-\*): wraps `namir_nam::PreparedNam`/`NamState` with the D-8.1
//! crossfade-capable dual-resource shape, D-9.2/9.3's per-block-rate-mismatch resampling, the
//! shared per-stage bypass crossfade (FR-CHAIN-020), and FR-CHAIN-050's mono-core-then-duplicate
//! channel handling.
//!
//! # The four-step handover, and where each step now lives
//!
//! FR-NAM-070 (glitch-free model swap) is D-8.1's four-step protocol: *prepare* (a worker builds
//! the whole [`NamSlot`] — see `crate::resource`'s module doc for why the slot, not just the
//! `Arc`), *offer* (through the command ring, arriving here as [`Stage::accept_resource`]),
//! *crossfade* (this file's [`Crossfade`] and the equal-power blend in `process_channel0`), and
//! *retire* (parked in `self.retired`, moved to the return ring by [`Stage::collect_retired`]).
//!
//! M2 built step 3 alone and proved it before a thread had to drive it; M4 wired the other three
//! around it, which is why the crossfade itself needed no rework.
//!
//! **The M2 gap this module used to document is closed.** Between M2 and M4 a completing handover
//! dropped the outgoing slot right here, on the audio thread — freeing its `NamState` scratch and
//! possibly the last `Arc<PreparedNam>` reference — and this comment recorded that as a real P1
//! violation rather than hiding it. It is gone: the finalization in `process_channel0` now `take()`s
//! the slot (a move) into `self.retired`, and the return ring carries it to a worker that can
//! afford to free it. The evidence is that this module's RT-allocation tests no longer stop short
//! of completion, and `handover_crossfade_has_no_large_single_sample_jump` now drives a full
//! real-to-real handover *inside* `rt_harness::audio_section` — which it could not do before.
//! There is a second, subtler drop site closed at the same time: an install that displaces a slot
//! still fading in used to drop the displaced slot. See [`NamStage::install`].
//!
//! # Resampling (D-9.2/9.3)
//!
//! Each slot independently resamples around the model it holds: engine rate → model rate before
//! inference, model rate → engine rate after. When a slot's model declares the same rate as the
//! engine, `NamSlot::resample` is `None` and inference runs directly on the engine's own blocks —
//! D-9.2's "bypassed entirely... zero cost and zero added latency" for the overwhelmingly common
//! 48 kHz case. When rates differ, [`SlotResampler`] runs the model on a **fixed internal block**
//! (D-9.2's own phrase) via `rubato::FftFixedInOut`, with an input FIFO accumulating engine-rate
//! samples until a full fixed block is ready and an output FIFO holding resampled-back results
//! until this stage's caller asks for them — see that struct's doc comment for the exact shape
//! and for this module's honest account of what is and isn't proven about it.
//!
//! # Why this is mono-core
//!
//! Same invariant `gate.rs` relies on (FR-CHAIN-050): by the time this stage runs, every channel
//! of `io` already carries an identical signal. Both slots (and any in-flight crossfade between
//! them) run on channel 0 only; the result is duplicated onto every other channel via the
//! scratch-shuttle pattern before the shared bypass blend runs.
//!
//! # FR-CHAIN-040 vs the handover crossfade — two independent fades, composed
//!
//! This stage carries *two* separate fade mechanisms that must not be confused:
//! 1. The **handover crossfade** ([`Crossfade`]), internal to this stage: an equal-power blend
//!    between `slots[active]`'s output and `slots[1 - active]`'s output, driven by
//!    [`NamStage::load_model`], independent of whether the stage is enabled at all.
//! 2. The **shared per-stage bypass blend** (`mix`/`mix_target`/`mix_coeff`, the same pattern
//!    `gate.rs`/`trim.rs` use), which blends the handover crossfade's *result* against this
//!    stage's dry input, based on `enabled && slots[active].is_some()`.
//!
//! `mix_target` is recomputed every time `enabled` changes, every time `active` changes (i.e. when
//! a handover completes) and at the start of every handover. Loading a *replacement* model into an
//! already fully-engaged stage never moves it: it is already 1.0 and stays there, so the handover
//! crossfade's own equal-power blend is heard in full.
//!
//! **Loading the very first model used to be the exception, and issue #141 is that it was the
//! wrong one.** `mix_target` was a function of `slots[active]` alone — deliberately the
//! *pre-handover* active slot, which on a first load is `None` — so the bypass blend stayed pinned
//! at 0.0 for the whole handover and multiplied the equal-power fade's result out of existence.
//! Measured on this stage: bit-exactly the dry input for all 960 samples of the fade, with the
//! model first becoming audible at the *start of the block* the fade completed in (frame 512, 768,
//! 896 and 959 for block sizes 512, 256, 64 and 1). FR-NAM-070's fade was inaudible and what
//! replaced it was the 15 ms bypass blend at a block-quantised instant. Since #141 the target
//! counts the slot a fade is fading *into* as well, and [`NamStage::begin_crossfade`] moves `mix`
//! there at once rather than ramping — read that method's doc comment for why an instant move is
//! the click-free choice here and a ramp is not.

/// length, and `into_model`'s declared output length equals `out_of_model`'s declared input
/// length (both derive their internal FFT sizes from `gcd(engine_hz, model_hz)`-based
