//! [`AppHost`]: this crate's [`namir_ui::UiHost`] implementation — the bridge between
//! `namir-ui`'s pure view layer and this crate's real [`crate::instance::SharedInstance`],
//! [`crate::worker::WorkerHandle`] and [`namir_worker::library::LibraryService`].
//!
//! # The bridge's shape, one frame at a time
//!
//! [`namir_ui::host`]'s own module doc comment fixes the contract: `snapshot` once, render, then
//! `dispatch` every intent that frame produced. [`AppHost::snapshot`] does four things, all cheap
//! (no blocking, no filesystem I/O — every blocking operation already ran, or is running, on
//! [`crate::worker::WorkerHandle`]'s own thread):
//!
//! 1. Drains [`crate::worker::WorkerHandle`]'s event queue and folds every [`crate::worker::AppEvent`]
//!    into this host's own state (`loaded_model_name`/`loaded_ir_name`, `notices`, the library
//!    snapshot/scan progress, `unsaved_changes`).
//! 2. Drains the telemetry ring and converts the two readings FR-UI-020 needs into
//!    [`namir_ui::MeterReading`]s — `telemetry.trim.peak_db`/`average_db` for the input meter (Trim
//!    is the first real stage after Gate, so its own peak/average readings are the closest thing
//!    this chain has to "the signal as it enters the amp/cab chain"), `telemetry.out.ch*.peak_db`/
//!    `average_db` for the output meter (the maximum across whichever channels are active, since a
//!    stereo chain's two channels can differ and FR-UI-020 wants one number).
//! 3. Reads the shared `State` mirror for current parameter values.
//! 4. Reads the shared `LibraryService` for the current index/scan-progress snapshot.
//!
//! [`AppHost::dispatch`] turns each [`namir_ui::UiIntent`] into either an immediate, non-blocking
//! submission through [`crate::instance::SharedInstance`] (`SetParam`/`ResetParamToDefault`, via
//! `namir_worker::Instance::try_submit_param`) or an [`crate::worker::AppCommand`] handed to the
//! worker thread (`LoadLibraryEntry`/`RescanLibraryRequested`/`CancelScanRequested`) — see
//! [`crate::worker`]'s module doc comment for why load/scan don't also go through the direct path.

    ///   any audio-affecting operation" rules a modal out of the row that also carries the recall
    ///   control, which *is* audio-affecting.
    /// - **A plain refusal** would make overwriting impossible from inside the application, and
    ///   re-saving a preset under the name it already has is the ordinary way to update one — the
    ///   guard would then have traded a data-loss path for a workflow the user can only complete
    ///   by deleting files behind Namir's back.
    /// - **A second, deliberate press** costs a fresh save nothing, needs no new intent and no view
    ///   state (so it holds for the plugin's copy of the same screen too), and is keyboard-operable
    ///   — Enter twice in the name box, FR-UI-030.
