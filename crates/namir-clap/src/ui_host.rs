//! [`ClapUiHost`]: this crate's `namir_ui::UiHost` implementation — the bridge FR-CLAP-100's
//! embedded GUI needs between `namir-ui`'s pure view layer (which may not depend on
//! `namir-engine`/`namir-worker`, per D-5.1) and this instance's real, live state
//! ([`crate::shared::SharedInner`]).
//!
//! # `snapshot`: three sources, one read-only picture
//!
//! - **Parameters** — [`crate::param_mirror::ParamMirror::snapshot`], the same lock-free mirror
//!   host automation and GUI dispatch both write through, so the GUI is never stale by more than
//!   the mirror's own atomic-store granularity.
//! - **Meters** — drained here, from the [`namir_engine::TelemetryReader`] this crate keeps a
//!   clone of once an engine exists (`crate::audio`'s `activate`). D-7.3's own reader is
//!   `Clone`, specifically so a UI-side consumer can hold one independent of whatever
//!   `namir_worker::Instance` does with the `WorkerEndpoint` it was built from. Only two ids are
//!   read: `telemetry.trim.peak_db` (post-trim input level) and `telemetry.out.ch{0,1}.peak_db`
//!   (post-output level, both channels). **Known gap, stated rather than glossed:** the engine
//!   publishes peak only, not RMS — `MeterReading::rms_db` is set equal to `peak_db` rather than
//!   left at a stale or fabricated value, and this is called out explicitly rather than presented
//!   as a real RMS reading.
//! - **Everything else** (loaded model/IR names, library index, notices, dirty flag) — read
//!   straight off [`SharedInner`]'s own fields.
//!
//! # `dispatch`: every intent converges on the same two channels a preset recall uses
//!
//! A [`namir_ui::UiIntent::SetParam`]/`ResetParamToDefault` writes the mirror *and* pushes a
//! `Command::Param` onto the live engine's ring directly with `RingProducer`'s own
//! `try_push`-under-a-producer-mutex path (`namir_worker::CommandSubmitter::try_submit` — "what
//! the UI thread uses" per that method's own doc comment) — never through
//! `AudioEngine::apply_param_direct`, which is reserved for the audio thread itself (see
//! `crate::audio`'s module doc comment for why mixing the two producers here would be unsound).
//! A `LoadLibraryEntry`/library rescan intent hands off to [`crate::worker_jobs`], which run on
//! [`namir_worker::pool::ThreadPool`] so this method itself never blocks the GUI thread (FR-UI-070:
//! "shall never interrupt audio" — and, by the same construction, never interrupt the GUI either).
