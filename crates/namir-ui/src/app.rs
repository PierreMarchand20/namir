/// the host knows what its own dialog would block.

/// `glXChooseFBConfig` as `GLX_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB_CAPABLE_ARB, 1`. A software X server offers no
/// sRGB-capable framebuffer config at all, so that request matches nothing and
/// `find_best_visual_config_for_gl` panics on its own `.expect("Could not fetch framebuffer
/// config")`. Measured under Xvfb on Mesa 25.2.8/llvmpipe: GLX itself is entirely healthy there --
/// direct rendering, a 4.5 core profile, 240 framebuffer configs -- and **not one** of those 240
/// carries the sRGB flag. That is why the failure reads as a GLX problem (issue #19's original
/// diagnosis): GLX is merely the call that comes back empty. Retrying without the flag opens the
/// window on the very same display.
///
/// Dropping the flag costs nothing visually on this stack, because nothing was using it: `egui_glow`
/// (0.35, the renderer `egui-baseview` 0.6 drives) calls `gl.disable(FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB)` in
/// `prepare_painting` on every frame it can, since egui's shader already emits gamma-encoded
/// colour and must not have the driver convert it again. So `srgb: true` only ever selected a
/// framebuffer *capable* of a conversion that egui then switched off.
///
/// Measured as far as one machine can measure it: a frame rendered through the fallback and read
/// back off the X server (`xwd`) paints `egui::Visuals::dark()`'s `panel_fill` as exactly
/// `(27, 27, 27)` -- byte-identical to `Color32::from_gray(27)`, so no linear-to-sRGB conversion is
/// being applied on write. The A/B against an sRGB framebuffer cannot be run on the same display,
/// since that is precisely the config no headless X server offers; for that half the evidence is
/// `egui_glow`'s `disable(FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB)`, read rather than executed.
///
/// # Why a caught panic is the failure signal
///
/// `baseview` 0.2.2 has no fallible open: both `Window::open_blocking` and `Window::open_parented`
/// end in `rx.recv().unwrap().unwrap()`, so a window thread that dies during setup reaches the
/// calling thread as a panic and as nothing else. A retry therefore has to catch one. The catch is
/// narrower than it looks: a panic raised by a *frame* runs on `baseview`'s own window thread,
/// which `open_blocking` absorbs in its `thread.join().unwrap_or_else(..)`, so what arrives here is
/// a window that failed to open.
///
/// A real display is unaffected -- its first attempt succeeds and `open` is called exactly once.
/// If the second attempt fails too, the failure was never about sRGB (no `DISPLAY` at all, say)
/// and its panic propagates unchanged rather than being swallowed.
