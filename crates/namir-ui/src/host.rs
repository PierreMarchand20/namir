//! [`UiHost`]: the seam D-5.1 requires between this crate's pure view layer and whatever crate
//! actually owns a live `namir_engine::Chain`, a `namir_worker` instance, and a real
//! `namir_library::Index` on disk -- `namir-app` and `namir-clap`, both built on top of this
//! crate. See this crate's top doc comment for the full architectural rationale; this module is
//! just the trait and the plain data types that cross it.
//!
//! # The shape of one frame
//!
//! Every rendered frame, in order:
//! 1. [`UiHost::snapshot`] is called once, first, producing a [`UiSnapshot`] -- a complete,
//!    read-only picture of everything FR-UI-020's screen shows, as of right now.
//! 2. The screen is rendered from that snapshot. Nothing rendered this frame can ever be stale by
//!    more than one frame's worth of host-side change, and nothing the view renders can itself
//!    change engine state -- only [`UiIntent`]s can.
//! 3. Every [`UiIntent`] the user actually triggered this frame (zero, on a frame with no
//!    interaction) is handed to [`UiHost::dispatch`], one call per intent, in the order the
//!    controls that produced them were laid out.
